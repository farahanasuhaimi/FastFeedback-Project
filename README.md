## Getting Started

1.  Run the development server:

        ```bash
        npm install react
        npm run dev
        ```

2.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with any browser to see the result.
3.  From here, can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page has auto-updates as we edit the file.

### For Review in the next lesson.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
